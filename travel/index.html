        <h2>Hokkaido Region</h2>
        <p>
            Out of all 8 regions in Japan, Hokkaido is unrivaled in terms of area. Fully encompassing the second largest
            island in the country, this northern-most region is the largest. It is separated from the
            main island, Honshu by the Tsugaru Strait. Hokkaido is known as Japan's Nature Island, comprising of
            beautiful wilderness, world class powder snowcapped mountains and some of the most fertile agricultural
            land in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Hokkaido is less densely populated than other regions in Japan, this region contains its own
            unique hotspots that have placed it firmly as one of most popular places to travel on earth. The ski resorts
            on Mount Yotei boast some of the most magnificent views while providing access to Hokkaido's world renowned
            natural hot springs. The plentiful farming and fishing culture in Hokkaido provides an isolated, yet
            special food experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you are wanting to take a hike through the many national parks in the spring and
            fall, hit the slopes after a fresh snowfall in winter or just enjoy one of the many festivals that occur
            year-round, Hokkaido is a magnificent tourist destination during every season.

            <h3>Sounkyo Ice Fall Festival</h3>
            <p>
                Located near the small hot spring resort town Sounkyo, the Ryusei and the Ginga waterfalls are an
                amazing site during from spring through fall. However, from January to March when winter is in full
                swing the waterfalls and nearby streams freeze completely turning the northern part of the
                Daisetsuzan National Park into a frozen wonderland. Sounkyo and the surrounding areas are filled with
                ice sculptures that turn into a colorful light display during the night. Frequent fireworks displays are
                held that light up the sky until the sun sets.

            <h3>Sapporo Summer Festival</h3>
            <p>
                Hokkaido's summer climate is milder than the rest of Japan and is perfect for brewing beer. A
                traditional for 70 years the Sapporo Brewery has held its annual Sapporo Summer Festival in nearby Odori
                Park, just a few blocks away from its facility. Alongside numerous other events such as the Tanuki
                Festival and the Hokkai Bon Odori, Sapporo's Odori Park hosts some of the most important events of the
                year.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are looking for a break from the city, during the weekend, just a couple of hours away in
                Nakafurano, the Kitahoshiyama Lavender Garden boasts a gorgeous lavender landscape in the morning with
                spectacular firework displays at night during this time of year as well.

            <h3>Spring Flower Festivals</h3>
            <p>
                Sakura festivals are more commonly associated with the main island Honshu, but Hokkaido has spring
                sakura festivals of its own as well. Between April and June every major city has a sakura hanami
                as well as many other competing flower festivals. Three notable places that are the perfect spot for
                viewing sakura blooms are Matsumae Park, Hokkaido Shrine and Odori Park. The climate at this time of
                year is perfect for a picnic or BBQ outside to view the flowers at the peak of Hokkaido's blooming
                season. It is a fantastic way to enjoy the unique culture and food alongside the locals in any city of the
                region.

            <h3>An Abundance of Food from Land to Sea</h3>
            <p>
                Dubbed the breadbasket of the nation, Hokkaido is the leading producer of all of Japan's
                agricultural products from rice and wheat to melons and potatoes. The combination of fertile soil
                thanks to the two large volcanic zones, and mild growing season due to its northern geographic location
                are perfect for these plants to thrive. Hokkaido also has a major impact on livestock production in Japan,
                accounting for eighteen percent of total livestock output. This region has a reputation for using
                traditional methods to produce high-quality dairy products using milk from cows that graze on the
                fertile grasslands. Tours of Hokkaido's most famous farms are a common attraction for travelers
                from other parts of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hokkaido is also the leader in fishing and aquaculture industries, in terms of quantity and value.
                Although you do not need a permit to fish in most rivers, the freshwater fish in lakes are naturally bred
                so the local governments regulate certain areas with strict fishing periods. Some rivers are also
                regulated, prohibiting any type of fishing all year. Contact the local government in the area to make
                sure you are not trespassing before casting your line. There are also many charters and guided fishing
                tours in the region offering an unparalleled experience whether you are landing a cherry salmon in
                Niseko or a prized bluefin tuna in the Tsugaru Strait.
